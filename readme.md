# Fragments Test Site

ðŸ§© Test site for the new Swup fragments feature.

### Compile Assets:

npm install && npm run build
```

### Run:

You need a PHP server. The [`<base>` tag](https://github.com/hirasso/swup-fragments-test-site/blob/master/inc/head.php#L3) probably needs to be adjusted to fit your project root, as well.
